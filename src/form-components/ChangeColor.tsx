/*
The ChangeColor component offers the user a bunch of radio buttons labeled with different colors; choosing a radio 
button updates the text and color of a nearby box of text.

- You will need state to represent the chosen color
- You are free to make up your own list of colors, but you must have AT LEAST 8 unique colors.
- Each color must be represented by a radio button.
- There should be a box of text with a data-testid="colored-box" attribute and value.
- The box of text should have the same text and backgroundColor style as the currently selected radio button.

HINT: We strongly recommend you use map to render all the colorâ€™s Form.Check tags rather than hardcoding each one!
HINT: We recommend you use the inline attribute for the radio buttons.
