/*
The GiveAttempts component simulates a user taking a quiz with a limited number of attempts, but also provides a way for them to gain as many attempts as they want via a numeric input box.

- You will need a state to represent the number of attempts the user has left, and another state to represent 
    the number of attempts they are requesting.
- The initial number of attempts left should be 3.
- The number of attempts left should be visible.
- There should be a numeric input box where the user can specify their requested number of attempts.
- There should be two buttons, one labeled use that decreases the attempts by one and one labeled gain that increases 
    the attempts by the amount in the input box.
- If the user attempts to request an invalid amount (e.g., the empty string "") that cannot be parsed as an integer, 
    then do not change their number of attempts.
- When the user is out of attempts, the use button should be disabled
